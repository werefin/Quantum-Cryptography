# Quantum Cryptography & Security
* **Lab 01 (QRNG)**: implementation of two types of QRNG, characterized by different degrees of trust on their elements. In particular, we have seen how an experimental setup based on a heralded single photon source and polarization measurements can be used to study trusted and Source-Device-Independent protocols.
In all the configurations one of the two photons generated by the spontaneous parametric
downconversion source is directly detected by a single photon detector and the time of
arrival is time-tagged as channel 1 by the time-to-digital converter. The instrument used in
the lab records the timestamps in base units, and a base unit corresponds to 1ps.
Then, for each configuration we performed a projective measurement on the polarization of
the second photon. The polarization measurement has been performed using a polarization
beam splitter, which transmits horizontally polarized photons and reflects vertically polarized
photons. This allows us to measure the polarization of the photon in the H/V basis. By
inserting a half-wave or a quarter-wave waveplate before the polarization beam splitter, we
could perform measurements in the D/A and L/R basis, respectively. Then, the photon was
detected and time-tagged. The photons transmitted by the polarization beam splitter were
tagged as channel 2 by the time-tagger and reflected photons were tagged as channel 3 by
the time-tagger. In a few configurations, we inserted a polarizer before the measurement
station to prepare a pure state instead of a mixed state.
